Settings Manager Application Project

This project was done for Android Application Developement @Rose-Hulman By Josh McCammon and Logan Ryan

The Goal of this project was to create an app that manages your settings. With the click of a button you can 
change the ringtone, notification, alarm, and system volume levels. It also allows you to change the ringtone, notification
and alarm sound itself. Finally, it also includes brightness as a setting that can be changed
